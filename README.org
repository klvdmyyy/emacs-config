Welcome to part of my not only development workflow.

~GNU Emacs~ is main part of my workflow

Currently my main system is Fedora GNU/Linux distribution with GNOME

* Keybindings

- =C-x p f= - Find files in project with =project-find-file=
- =s-B= - Switch buffer with =consult-buffer=
- =C-s= - Find text in file with =consult-line=
- =C-c a= - Jumping between Org Agenda headings
- (corfu-mode-map) =M-n=, =M-p= - Scroll in-region completion docs
- (corfu-mode-map) =M-d= - Toggle corfu docs
- (org-mode-map) =C-s= - Jumping between headings in org mode with =consult-org-heading=

* Modules

** Autoloaded

- Core - Basic GNU Emacs setup
- Tweaks - GNU Emacs tweaking (performance, gc, etc)
- Appearance - UI related things
- Completion - Completion related things
- Productivity - Basically it's just Org Mode
- Development - Git, Terminal, Editing, etc

** Could be loaded with =load-user-module=

TODO

* Roadmap

- [ ] Customize default Emacs modeline
- [X] Setup completion with Corfu
- [ ] Make completion more beatifully
- [ ] Tweak performance with all modules (todo: read about profiling)
  - [ ] Read about usage of =autoload=, =with-eval-after-load=, =eval-when-compile= and tweak all configuration
