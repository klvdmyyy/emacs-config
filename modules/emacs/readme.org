This is main part of my system configuration because I do a lot of things in GNU Emacs.

* Structure of Emacs configuration

- =home.nix= - General Emacs configuration file. In this file we define general configuration
- =config/*.el= - ELisp source files (maybe rename from =config= to =elisp=)

* todolist

- [ ] Rework (move from rde code). Just write my own configuration
  - [ ] Use Hyrdra and my keybindings
  - [ ] Configure mini-frame (for now it's so laggy and don't work properly)
- [ ] Setup Org mode
- [ ] JetBrains Mono font
- [ ] Setup direnv
- [ ] Setup Magit and Projectile
