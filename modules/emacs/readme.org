#+TITLE: Excellent Emacs configuration with Nix
#+DESCRIPTION: Inspired by `rde' guix-distribution
#+AUTHOR: Klementiev Dmitry <klementievd08@yandex.ru>

This is main part of my system configuration because I do a lot of things in GNU Emacs.

* Structure of Emacs configuration

- =default.nix= - the Emacs package. In this file we enabling native-compilation, pgtk and compile packages.
- =home.nix= - General Emacs configuration file. In this file we define =early-init.el= and general configuration. Also in home nix file we import other features
- =config/*.el= - ELisp source files (maybe rename from =config= to =elisp=)

* Why not Guix?

For now unique advantages of Guix is not enough to move.
